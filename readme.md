ront end web development ultimate course 2021 from Udemy Here you will be able to find all the code that I wrote during the course.

I will not write anything in connection with jQuery and Bootstrap becuase my focus is to move faster to code in JavaScript and then start the 3rd course about React and so on.

If you have any questions feel free to contact me ! stefan.mihaylovski@gmail.com
